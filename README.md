# CS-Py
A Python Project that uses Valve's game state integration service to augment the player experience in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. By Isaac Park, CS Major @ UIUC.

### Current Project Objectives (By Priority)
#### 1. Implement by-round data storage for statistical analysis using Pandas dataframes
#### 2. Integrate SQL database functionality and store player data by individual rounds.
#### 3. Develop front-end GUI for the program (probably an in-web-browser application) to display player statistics and graphs
#### 4. Develop full-screen (transparent) overlay to be used on top of the CSGO application as a live statistics indicator display for the player.
