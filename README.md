# CS-Py
A Python Project that uses Valve's game state integration service to augment the player experience in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. By Isaac Park, CS Major @ UIUC.

### Current Project Objectives (By Priority)
#### 1. Implement by-round data storage for statistical analysis using Pandas dataframes
#### 2. Integrate SQL database functionality and store player data by individual rounds.
#### 3. Integrate Logitech's RGB SDK for its gaming mice to trigger colors depending on in-game events.
#### 4. Develop front-end GUI for the program (probably an in-web-browser application) to display player statistics and graphs
#### 5. Develop full-screen (transparent) overlay to be used on top of the CSGO application as a live statistics display for the player.

### Current Ideas For Player Statistics & Analysis
#### 1. KDR and KDA
#### 2. HSR
#### 3. modified KAST (based on HLTV, but changed to not take traded kills into account).
#### 4. Correlation between # of kills and monetary value of primary + secondary weapon in each round
#### 5. Using all of the above statistics to determine how well a player overall plays on different maps.
#### 6. Using all of the above statistics to determine how CT/T-sided a player tends to play (also depending on the map).
#### 7. Graphing these statistics by time to see player's skill improvement.
